## Vancouver Crime Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of crime trends in Vancouver, aiming to uncover insights, predict future crime rates, and compare neighborhood crime patterns. The project leverages Python for data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.

## Project Objectives
+ Descriptive Analysis: Explore historical crime data to observe trends, patterns, and variations in crime occurrences over time. Identify frequently occurring crimes and neighborhoods with high crime rates. Investigate possible seasonality and relationships with holidays.

+ Predictive Modeling: Utilize linear regression techniques to predict the city's crime rate up to the year 2035. Understand the potential impact of population growth on crime rates and project future changes in crime occurrences.

+ Neighborhood Comparison: Conduct a detailed comparison of crime rates among different neighborhoods. Uncover spatial variations in crime occurrences and identify factors influencing crime patterns at the neighborhood level.

+ Clustering Analysis: Apply clustering algorithms to group similar types of crimes or neighborhoods based on specific characteristics. Gain insights into common crime profiles and underlying factors contributing to crime patterns.

## Data Source
The analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset of Vancouver crime incidents sourced from the [Vancouver Police Open Data](https://geodash.vpd.ca/opendata/#). This dataset is updated weekly, providing a valuable and up-to-date resource for understanding crime trends and patterns within the city.
