## Vancouver Crime Data Analysis and Insights üïµÔ∏è
This project provides a comprehensive view of Vancouver's crime trends, utilizing data that will be updated weekly by the Vancouver Police Department. The data cleaning, preparation, and EDA were conducted in Python, followed by the creation of an engaging interactive report using Power BI.
 
The report breaks down the crime data into key sections, each offering distinct insights into Vancouver's crime patterns:
  + Overview: A snapshot of overall crime trends from 2003 to 2023.
  + Crime Types: In-depth exploration of different crime categories.
  + Temporal Analysis: Analysis of how crime rates fluctuate over time.
  + Geographical Insights: Distribution of crimes across Vancouver.
  + Yearly Comparisons: Examination of year-over-year changes and patterns.
  + Monthly and Daily Trends: Analysis of crime patterns across months and days, highlighting seasonal and day-specific trends.
 
Throughout this project, I've utilized the latest Power BI features, including the new card visual and Reference label and also the new DAX Query View which has made Power BI a more productive tool for modifying measures, writing and debugging DAX queries. I've also delved into creating a composite visual using Deneb Heatmap with Marginal bars, leveraging the Vega-Lite language for richer insights.

## Data Source
The analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset of Vancouver crime incidents sourced from the [Vancouver Police Open Data](https://geodash.vpd.ca/opendata/#).
This dataset is updated weekly, providing a valuable and up-to-date resource for understanding crime trends and patterns within the city.
